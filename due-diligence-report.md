# Deep Dip 2: Organizer Due Diligence Report

- XertroV, July 2024

This report is a summary of our due diligence efforts following Deep Dip 2. By "due diligence" we mean: making sure that the integrity of the competition was maintained and that players didn't cheat.

## Main Findings

After investigating all identified anomalies and concerns brought to the team's attention, we are pleased to announce that we believe Bren, eLconn, and Hazard each achieved their finishes legitimately.

The rest of this report will briefly discuss our due diligence process, deficiencies and issues that arose, things that worked well, and some ideas and direction for future events.

## Due Diligence Process

Two main methods were used:
- Investigating external reports received over the event
- Using gathering data: detecting and identifying suspicious events, then cross-referencing with other information

Reports from



-
- duplicate / shared IP addresses
- editor sessions, vehicle positions
- map loads without plugin


Even before the event, we planned to
Although we avoided publicly discussing

Note: The focus of analysis was on the top 3, although other player's data was analyzed to some extent.
## Shortcomings / Weaknesses

* ? missing vods

* plugin day 1-4 issues
* for next time: plugin performance mode
* plugin accuracy -- errant "PB"s, improper filtering of contexts early on

* due diligence took a while

* Map Protections
  * lack of protections lead to CP versions early on

* Future Things
  * Better, more comprehensive map protections
    * community tools like gbxexplorer
    * editor crashing
    * map encryption (would require plugin to load the map -- which would be a problem for console players)
      * perhaps with nadeo's help we could offer a console-only version (possibly could piggy-back off crossplay separation for this)


## good stuff

* vods
  * very useful for clearing suspicious events
  * may require streaming in future, but with an option like streaming to a private server that is only there to archive footage as competitors may not want to stream to twitch

## How Widespread was Cheating?

## ideas

- some call via openplanet that only works for signed plugins (not running in school/dev mode)
